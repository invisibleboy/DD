##DD
===========

"This tiny extension replaces :ÛŒ with :D in all inputs.



   
##How to install it:
-------------------------------------

1. Download CRX file called 'DD.crx'
2. Open a new tab
3. Drag your recently downloaded CRX file to the new tab
4. Accept

IMPORTANT: recent versions of Google Chrome don't allow to install extensions as I mentioned above, so try the next
steps in order to install the extension:

1. Download the folder called "Uncompressed"
2. Rename it as "DD".
3. Open "Extensions" settings in Google Chrome.(chrome://extensions/)
4. Click on "Load uncompressed extension...".
5. Select the folder "DD".                 

I will very thankfully if you find any suggestions, improvements or comments about it and send it to me to my e-mail (taram.mohammad[at]gmail[dot]com)
